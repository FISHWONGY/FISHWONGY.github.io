A while ago, I wrote a [post](https://fishwongy.github.io/post/20230812_poetry/) about using poetry as a python package manager. Today, I want to introduce you to another package manager called uv.

      What is UV?
    </p>
</b></u>

According to [Astral](https://astral.sh/), the author of uv, uv is an extremely fast Python package installer and resolver, written in Rust, and designed as a drop-in replacement for pip and pip-tools workflows.

uv represents a milestone in our pursuit of a "Cargo for Python": a comprehensive Python project and package manager that's fast, reliable, and easy to use.

      Setting Up uv
    </p>
</b></u>

1 - Installation

```powershell
pip install uv
```

```powershell
pipx install uv
```

2 - Creating a virtual environment

```powershell
uv venv --python 3.12
```

3 - Activating the virtual environment

```powershell
source .venv/bin/activate
```

4 - Managing packages

First, we will need a pyproject.toml file. Here is an example of a pyproject.toml file:

```toml
[project]
name = "my-uv-project"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "This is a project that uses uv as a package manager."
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.12, <3.13"
dependencies = [
    "ruff>=0.2.0",
]
```

If your project need to use any of the private github package, then we can add the following to the pyproject.toml file:

```toml
[project]
name = "my-uv-project"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "This is a project that uses uv as a package manager."
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.12, <3.13"
dependencies = [
    "ruff>=0.2.0",
]

[tool.ruff.lint]
extend-select = ["I"]

[tool.uv.sources]
private-lib = { git = "ssh://git@github.com/fishwongy/private-lib.git" }
private-repo = { git = "ssh://git@github.com/fishwongy/private-repo.git" }
```

```powershell
uv pip install -r pyproject.toml
```


5 - Deploying the project

Dockerfile without private repo

```Dockerfile
FROM --platform=linux/amd64 python:3.12-slim

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 \
    PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 \
    UV_VERSION=0.4.4


ENV PATH="/root/.local/bin:$PATH"

RUN pip install pipx
RUN pipx install uv==${UV_VERSION}

COPY app .

CMD ["uv", "run", "python3", "main.py"]
```

Dockerfile with private repo
```Dockerfile
FROM --platform=linux/amd64 python:3.12-slim

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 \
    PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 \
    UV_VERSION=0.4.4

RUN apt update -y && apt install -y ssh git wget unzip libaio1 && \
    apt-get clean

ENV PATH="/root/.local/bin:$PATH"

RUN pip install pipx
RUN pipx install uv==${UV_VERSION}

COPY ./uv.lock pyproject.toml /usr/src/app
RUN ssh-keyscan github.com >> /root/.ssh/known_hosts
RUN --mount=type=ssh uv sync -vvv

COPY app .

CMD ["uv", "run", "python3", "main.py"]
```

skaffold.yaml for ssh
```yaml
apiVersion: skaffold/v2beta28
kind: Config
metadata:
  name: my-uv-app
build:
  local:
    useBuildkit: true
  artifacts:
  - image: docker.io/fishwongy/my-uv-app
    docker:
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
      ssh: default

deploy: {}

profiles:
  - name: production
    activation:
      - kubeContext: prod
    deploy:
      kustomize:
        paths:
          - ./deploy/production

  - name: staging
    activation:
      - kubeContext: stg
    deploy:
      kustomize:
        paths:
          - ./deploy/staging

  - name: development
    activation:
      - kubeContext: dev
    deploy:
      kustomize:
        paths:
          - ./deploy/development
```

Thatâ€™s it for now.

Thank you for reading and have a nice day!
