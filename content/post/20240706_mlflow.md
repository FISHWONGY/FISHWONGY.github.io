      What is MLFlow?
</b></u>

</p>

MLflow is an open-source platform to manage the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle. It tackles three primary functions: tracking experiments to record and compare parameters and results, packaging code into reproducible runs, and sharing and deploying models. MLflow is library-agnostic and can be used with any machine learning library, and in any programming language, since all functions are accessible through REST APIs and CLI commands. It is designed to work with any existing ML library or framework, and can be easily integrated with scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.


To start off the series, in today's post, we will be 

1 - Deploying MLFlow on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Cloud Run.

2 - Set up load balancing, cloud armor policy, custom domain, and SSL certificate for the MLFlow server for restrcited access. 

3 - Set up a secret manager to store the MLFlow server's credentials and access them in the deployment process. 

4 - Deploy a simple machine learning model using MLFlow and test the deployment.

      Deploying MLFlow on GCP
</b></u>


<u><b>Basic Configuration</b></u>


1 - Create a service account with neccessary permissions to access the GCP resources.
At the minimum, the service account should have the following roles:
- Cloud Run Invoker
- Storage Object Viewer
- Secret Manager Secret Accessor
- Cloud container admin

For example, the following command can be used to add the roles to the service account:

```bash
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding gcp-prj-id-123 \
    --member "serviceAccount:svc@gcp-prj-id-123.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
    --role "roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor" \
    --role "roles/cloudobjectstorage.objectViewer" \
    --role "roles/container.admin" \
    --role "roles/cloudrun.invoker" 
```

2 - Obtain a credential file for the service account.

You can do so by navigating to `IAM & Admin` > `Service Accounts` > `Select the service account` > `Keys` > `Add Key` > `Click on the "Create Key"` button.

3 - Create Cloud storage bucket to store the MLFlow artifacts.

Confirm the the service account that will be used to deploy the application has the necessary permissions to access the bucket.

4 - Create a Cloud SQL instance to store the MLFlow metadata.

You can choose either MySQL or PostgreSQL as the database engine. In this example, we will use PostgreSQL.

Fill in the instance name, password, and other necessary details.

Create a database and a user for the MLFlow server.

To create database
`SQL component` > `Databases` > `Create Database`

To create user
`SQL instance details` > `Users` > `Add User Account`

Enable SSL connection to the database.
`SQL component` > `Connections` > `Create Database` > `Security` > `Manage SSL mode` > 
`Allow only SSL connections under SSL mode`

Then under Manage client certificates, click on the "Create client certificate" button to download the client certificate.

5 - Create a secret in the Secret Manager to store the database credentials.

Create Secret:

mlflow_artifact_url: Storage Bucket where MLflow artifacts are stored, for example, `gs://mlflow`
mlflow_database_url: Sample value 
`postgresql+psycopg2://<db-user>:<db-pass>@/<db-name>?host=/cloudsql/gcp-prj-id-123:us-central1:<cloud-sql-instance-name>`

Not that the Cloud SQLinstance name can be copied from Cloud SQL instance overview page

mlflow_tracking_username: Basic HTTP auth username for MLflow (your choice)
mlflow_tracking_password: your choice



<u><b>Deploying server</b></u>

Folder structure for the project:


```md

├── deploy
│   └── production
│       └── service.yaml
├── entry-point.sh

└── skaffold.yaml
```

Dockerfile as below:
```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.10-slim

ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=True

ENV POETRY_VERSION=1.7.1 \
    USERNAME=nonroot

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

RUN adduser $USERNAME

RUN poetry install -nv --no-root

COPY app .

COPY entry-point.sh ./entry-point.sh

ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/bin/env", "bash", "./entry-point.sh"]

EXPOSE 8080
```



Set up `skaffold.yaml` as below:

```yaml
apiVersion: skaffold/v4beta2
kind: Config
metadata:
  name: mlflow-gcp
build:
  artifacts:
  - image: us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/gcp-prj-id-123/mlflow-gcp/mlflow-gcp
    docker:
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    platforms:
      - "linux/amd64"
profiles:
- name: production
  manifests:
    rawYaml:
    - deploy/production/service.yaml
deploy:
  cloudrun:
    projectid: gcp-prj-id-123
    region: us-central1
```

And the `service.yaml` file in the deployment/production folder as below:
```yaml
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mlflow-gcp
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        run.googleapis.com/cloudsql-instances: gcp-prj-id-123:us-central1:mlflow-pgsql
        run.googleapis.com/startup-cpu-boost: 'true'
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: svc@developer.gserviceaccount.com
      containers:
      - image: us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/gcp-prj-id-123/mlflow-gcp/mlflow-gcp
        ports:
        - name: http1
          containerPort: 8080
        env:
        - name: GCP_PROJECT
          value: gcp-prj-id-123
        resources:
          limits:
            memory: 1Gi
            cpu: 1000m

```

To deploy the server, run the following command:

```bash
skaffold run -p production
```

And here you go, after successful deployment, you can access the MLFlow server at the URL provided in the Cloud Run service details.

And when clicked on it, it will prompt for the username and password that you have set in the secret manager.

<u><b>
    <p style="font-size:20pt ">
      Setting up restricted access to MLFlow server
</b></u>

Now, the next set up our MLFlow UI so that it is only accessible to the users who are on the specific IP addresses, instead of making the application public and only protected by the basic HTTP auth.


<u><b>Custom restriction access with Cloud Armor</b></u>
Under `Network Security` > `Cloud Armor Policies` > `Create Policy` 
For Policy type, select `Backend security policy`

Fill in the necessary details and choose the `Allow` action and add the IP addresses that you want to allow access to the MLFlow server.

<p align="center">
<img alt = 'png' src='/images/on_mlflow/cloud-armor.png'/>
</p>

<u><b>Creating up SSL certificate</b></u>
Under `Security` > `SSL Certificates` > `Create Certificate` > Fill in the necessary details and choose `Create Google-managed certificate` then click on the `Create` button.

<u><b>Setting up Load Balancing</b></u>

To set up the load balancer, navigate to the `Cloud network services` > `Load balancing` > `Create Load Balancer`.

<p align="center">
<img alt = 'png' src='/images/on_mlflow/mlflow-lb-create.png'/>
</p>

For type of load balancer, choose `HTTP(S) Load Balancing`, and follow the default settings.

<p align="center">
<img alt = 'png' src='/images/on_mlflow/mlflow-lb-create-settings.png'/>
</p>

The next step is to set up the frontend configuration, for `protocol` choose HTTPS and for `certificate`, choose the SSL certificate that we created in the previous step.

<p align="center">
<img alt = 'png' src='/images/on_mlflow/mlflow-lb-fe-settings.png'/>
</p>

For the backend configuration, click on `Create a backend service`,  for `backend type` choose `Serverless network endpoint group` and under `Backend` clcik on `Add backend`.

<p align="center">
<img alt = 'png' src='/images/on_mlflow/mlflow-lb-be-settings.png'/>
</p>

Then under click `Create Serverless network endpoint group`, under `select service`, choose the cloud run app that we created for MLFlow.

<p align="center">
<img alt = 'png' src='/images/on_mlflow/mlflow-lb-nw-ep-grp.png'/>
</p>

Under `Cloud CDN` disable the Cloud CDN.

Under `Security`, choose the Cloud Armor policy that we created in the previous step.

<p align="center">
<img alt = 'png' src='/images/on_mlflow/mlflow-lb-cdn-security-settings.png'/>
</p>

After all of the above steps, click on the `Create` button to create the load balancer.


<u><b>Setting up IAP</b></u>

Navigate to `Security` > `Identity-Aware Proxy`, If you don't see the IAP option, you may have to add it by clicking on the `Connect Application` button.

Turn on IAP for the load balancer backend services of the Cloud Run servic under `All Web Services` > `Backend Services`.

<u><b>Setting up custom domain</b></u>
To begin with is step, we will have to enable the `Cloud DNS API` on the GCP project.
Then, we can navigaye to the `Network Services` > `Cloud Doains` > `Reguster Domain` > Fill in the necessary details and click on the `Create` button.


<u><b>Setting up Cloud DNS</b></u>

To set up the Cloud DNS, navigate to the `Cloud DNS` page and the domain that we chose from the above step should already be showing there. Click on the domain name and then click on the `Add Standard` under `Record Set`.

Under Resource Type, choose `A`
And for `IPv4 Address`, place the IP address of the load balancer that we created in the previous step.

<p align="center">
<img alt = 'png' src='/images/on_mlflow/cloud-dns.png'/>
</p>

<u><b>Setting up OAuth Consent Screen</b></u>
Navigate to `API and Services` > `OAuth consent screen` > Add our domain to the Authorized domains


<u><b>Restricting access to Cloud Run ingress</b></u>

Now as the final step, we will restrict the access to the Cloud Run ingress.
Navigate to the `Cloud Run service details` > `Networking` > `Ingress Control` > `Allow internal traffic only`

<p align="center">
<img alt = 'png' src='/images/on_mlflow/cloudrun-ingress.png'/>
</p>

Or if we don't want to do it manually on the GCP Console, we can modify the `deploy/production/service.yaml` to as below

```yaml
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mlflow-gcp
  annotations:
    run.googleapis.com/ingress: internal-and-cloud-load-balancing
    run.googleapis.com/ingress-status: internal-and-cloud-load-balancing
spec:
# Rest of the original spec
```

Now, if you are not connecting to the MLFlow server from the allowed IP addresses, you will not be able to access the server and it will return a 403 forbidden response.

<img alt = 'png' src='/images/on_mlflow/mlflow-403.png'/>
</p>

    <p style="font-size:20pt ">
      Simple Machine Learning Model
</b></u>

Now, with everything set up, let's deploy a simple machine learning model using MLFlow and test the deployment.

As a first step, let's preprocess the data and prepare it for training.

```python
white_wine = pd.read_csv(".winequality-white.csv", sep=";")
red_wine = pd.read_csv("./winequality-red.csv", sep=";")

red_wine['is_red'] = 1
white_wine['is_red'] = 0
data = pd.concat([red_wine, white_wine], axis=0) 
data.rename(columns=lambda x: x.replace(' ', '_'), inplace=True)

high_quality = (data.quality >= 7).astype(int)
data.quality = high_quality
```

Next, let's split the data into training, validation, and test sets.
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split 
X = data.drop(["quality"], axis=1)
y = data.quality

X_train, X_rem, y_train, y_rem = train_test_split(X, y, train_size=0.6, random_state=123)

X_val, X_test, y_val, y_test = train_test_split(X_rem, y_rem, test_size=0.5, random_state=123)
```

Set up the necessary classes and functions to log the model and deploy it using MLFlow.

```python
class SklearnModelWrapper(mlflow.pyfunc.PythonModel): 
  def __init__(self, model):
    self.model = model
  def predict(self, context, model_input):
    return self.model.predict_proba(model_input)[:,1]

class GCPSecrets:
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self.client = secretmanager.SecretManagerServiceClient()
        self.base_url = f"projects/{PROJECT_ID}/secrets"

    def get_secret(self, secret):
        secret_response = self.client.access_secret_version(
            name=f"{self.base_url}/{secret}/versions/latest"
        )
        creds = secret_response.payload.data.decode("UTF-8")
        return creds
```

Set up the MLFlow configuration.
```python
os.environ["MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI"]  = secrets.get_secret("mlflow_tracking_url")
os.environ["MLFLOW_TRACKING_USERNAME"] = secrets.get_secret("mlflow_tracking_username")
os.environ["MLFLOW_TRACKING_PASSWORD"] = secrets.get_secret("mlflow_tracking_password")
```

Now, let's train the model and log it using MLFlow.
```python
with mlflow.start_run(run_name='untuned_random_forest'):
  n_estimators = 10
  model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=n_estimators, random_state=np.random.RandomState(123))
  model.fit(X_train, y_train)

  predictions_test = model.predict_proba(X_test)[:,1]
  auc_score = roc_auc_score(y_test, predictions_test)
  mlflow.log_param('n_estimators', n_estimators)
  mlflow.log_metric('auc', auc_score)
  wrappedModel = SklearnModelWrapper(model)
  signature = infer_signature(X_train, wrappedModel.predict(None, X_train))
  
  conda_env =  _mlflow_conda_env(
        additional_conda_deps=None,
        additional_pip_deps=["cloudpickle=={}".format(cloudpickle.__version__), "scikit-learn=={}".format(sklearn.__version__)],
        additional_conda_channels=None,
    )
  mlflow.pyfunc.log_model("random_forest_model", python_model=wrappedModel, conda_env=conda_env, signature=signature)
```

Examine the learned feature importances output by the model as a sanity-check.
```python
feature_importances = pd.DataFrame(model.feature_importances_, index=X_train.columns.tolist(), columns=['importance'])
feature_importances.sort_values('importance', ascending=False)
```

Now, let's register the model and transition it to the "Production" stage.
```python
from mlflow.tracking import MlflowClient
client = MlflowClient()

run_id = mlflow.search_runs(filter_string='tags.mlflow.runName = "untuned_random_forest"').iloc[0].run_id

model_name = "wine_quality"
model_version = mlflow.register_model(f"runs:/{run_id}/random_forest_model", model_name)

client.set_registered_model_alias(name=model_name, alias="Production", version=model_version.version)
client.transition_model_version_stage(
  name=model_name,
  version=model_version.version,
  stage="Production",
)
```

Finally, load the model and test it.
```python
model = mlflow.pyfunc.load_model(f"models:/{model_name}@Production")

print(f'AUC: {roc_auc_score(y_test, model.predict(X_test))}')
```

<p align="center">
<img alt = 'png' src='/images/on_mlflow/mlflow-auc.png'/>
</p>

Making a prediction with the model

```python
prediction = model.predict(X_test[:5])

print(f'Prediction: {prediction}')
```

<p align="center">
<img alt = 'png' src='/images/on_mlflow/mlflow-predict.png'/>
</p>

Now, if we navigate to the MLFlow UI, we should see the model's artifacts.
<p align="center">
<img alt = 'png' src='/images/on_mlflow/mlflow-random-forest-artifacts.png'/>
</p>


You will also see the model is registered under model registry.

<p align="center">
<img alt = 'png' src='/images/on_mlflow/mlflow-random-forest-model.png'/>
</p>

And that's it! 

We have successfully deployed a simple machine learning model using MLFlow on GCP and tested the deployment.
