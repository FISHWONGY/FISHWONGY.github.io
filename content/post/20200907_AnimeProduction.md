>For this analysis on Japanese Anime, data are scraped from the website [***My Anime List***](https://myanimelist.net/).I divided the analysis into 2 large part, the anime producer and anime studio.

First of all, let's briefly check the overall popularity of different anime genre.
<p align="center">

</p>

Generally, a larger number of produced anime does not necessarily mean more popularity. Most highly rated anime genre by audiences are Thriller, Josei and psychological. On the other hand, although Kids, Dementia and Music anime are mass-produced, their ratings are the lowest.

      Anime Producers
    </p>
</b></u>

 I first looked at the top 10 anime producers by the total number of anime they produced and the amount of anime they produced over time.
<p align="center">

</p>

As shown in the graph, even though TV Tokyo produced the most anime, Aniplex is catching up in recent years, especially after the 2010s.

Then we can have a closer look at the top 10 genres produced by different well-known anime producers.
<p align="center">

</p>

It is obvious that apart from NHK that focus more on Kids cartoon production, most of the producers focus on producing Comedy and Action anime.

</p>

Generally, Dentsu, Aniplex and Square Enix's anime are most highly rated by audiences. However, there are 2 outliers, Voque ting and Miracle Robo that have not produced a lot of anime but their ratings are extremely high. One of the potential reasons is that Voque ting is the producers of the well-know <mark>Kimi no na 你的名字</mark> was and <mark>Tenki no ko 天氣之子</mark>.

 Then now we can do the same analysis for anime studio.

</p>

Same as Anime producer, even though Tohei Animation produced the most anime, A-1 Pictures is catching up in recent years, especially after the 2010s. 

Some of the famous anime from A-1 Pictures are Fairy Tail and  Magi.

</p>

Also similar to Anime producers, most of the studios focus on producing Comedy and Action anime.

</p>

Lastly, A-1 Pictures and Production I.G.'s anime are most highly rated by audiences. However, there are 2 outliers, Egg Firm and Shuka that have produced relatively less anime but their ratings are extremely high. While Egg firm is known for the production of comedy anime like <mark>Saiki Kusuo no sai-nan 齊木楠雄的災難</mark> which is currently on Netflix, <mark>Shuka produces anime like Natsume Yuujinchou 夏目友人帳</mark>.
