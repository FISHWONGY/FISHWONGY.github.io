I recently came across a data set by the BLS with the data of the US employee's salary data from the past decade, and thought it'd be nice to post a quick update here - This will be a really short post!


Firstly, I look at the income range of male and female in differnt age group and ethnicity group in 2010 Q1 and 2020 Q4 for comparison.

</p>

It goes without saying that the most significant trend is that despite age and ethnicity, men are in general always earning more than women, and the gap is only getting larger in recent years.

Both plot show that only the 16-24 yo age group and some other minority group such as Black or African American and Hispanic or Latino group have a minor gap between gender. However, it is important to point out these groups are in general earning the least as well.

In 2010, Asain is already earning the most in average among all other ethnicity group. The trend only went further throughout the decade, and in 2020, Asian woman is earning in average $1,091, which is nearly what a White American man earns. However, the gap between the income of Asian Men and Women is also the largest, with a roughly $300 gap.

After comparing the difference income range between men and women. I then focused on annalysing 
the income difference in 2010 and 2020 for both gender separatedly.

Let's first look at male.

Unsurprisinglt there's a salary rise in all group. In all age group, there's a ~$200 rise since 2010. However, if we look at the ethnicity group, while all ethnicity group also has a ~$200 rise in the past 10 years, Asain male has a $510 rise.

And female group  show a similar trend but less extreme.

As a closing remark, I think I am most shocked with the fact that seeing Asian is earning the most despite gender among all ethnicity group. It'd be intersting if we can dig a bit deeper to see which industry these people work at. I'm also intersted to know will this trend applicable in some other extremely globalised country such as the UK.

That's it for now.
