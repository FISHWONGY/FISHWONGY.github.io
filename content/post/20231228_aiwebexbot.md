<div style="text-align: justify">

I like to build chatbots, because it is fun. 

In the past, I have built chatbots with application like [line](https://github.com/FISHWONGY/line-bot), and [discord](https://github.com/FISHWONGY/discord-bot) 

With Generative AI (Gen AI) being the hot topic this year, I have always wanted to build something I am interested in with it. During this Christmas break, I finally have the time to sit down and build it ðŸ¤“.

      Overview

</p>


The Webex Chatbot uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model to provide automated responses. It was developed in Python and uses the Azure OpenAI API, Webex API and Jira API for chat operations and its core functionalities.


<u>Architecture</u>

</p>

<u><b>
    <p style="font-size:20pt ">
      Features
</b></u>

- SQL Debugging and Optimization: The chatbot can understand SQL queries and help with debugging and optimization.
- Code Assistance: The chatbot can provide assistance with code-related issues.
- Jira Story Creation: The chatbot can create Jira stories based on user input.



<u>Usage</u>

To use the bot, send messages to it on Webex using the following command format:

For SQL debugging: 
```md 
!sqldebug <your SQL query> #error <your error message>
```

For SQL optimization:
```md 
!sqlopt <your SQL query> #opt <your optimization related message>
```

For SQL formatting: 
```md 
!sqlformat <your SQL query>
```

For programming assistance: 
```md 
!codeq -l <prog-lang> -q <your question or code>
```

To create a jira story: 
```md 
!jspost #{role} <story title>
```

Optional parameters: 
```md 
!jspost #{role} <story title> -u <user-id> -e <epic-id> -t <team-id> -sp <story-points> 
```

To get AI generated jira story content: 
```md 
!jsget #{role} <story title>
```


<u>Design Explanations</u>


We can easily see that the commands for different functions are slightly different; while some commands use `-` for extra parameters, some use `#` for extra optional parameters.

To be honest, I'd prefer to use `-` for all optional params so that it is more similar to a proper CLI. However, when working with languages like SQL, the use of `-` is common inside the code.


```sql
-- For example when we are commenting
SELECT *
FROM tbl
```

I may be able to get away with it if I go down to the route of using explicit [regex](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/regular-expression-language-quick-reference) , however considering how often  ` -- something` is used in SQL syntax, I decided to just use `#` to resolve the issue once and for all this time.

      Final Thoughts
</b></u>


Prompting is important when working with Gen AI, in fact, Open AI has published a [guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering/strategy-write-clear-instructions) for better prompt engineering.

For the project this time, I have tried the below tactics.

- Start with building a personality
Setting
```md
You are a <role>, you are good at <subject>, your job is to help <action>
```

- Giving specific example on the expected answer or outcome
```md
For example, I will ask you a question: <question>.
You have to answer as the below strcuture, such as <provide-detailed-answer-structure>
```

- Positivity & Compliment


It could be frustrating when Gen AI is constantly not giving the output we are looking for; I get it. But it is better to sound positive for better Gen AI performance.

```md
Good job, we are getting there slowly. <part-of-the-gen-ai-response> is what I want, however ... <explicit-comment-on-desire-output>
```

Here is an example of the prompting function that I have for the bot. I tested it many times with different inputs to observe its response, and then I adjusted the user-assistant prompt based on the answer.

```python
def construct_prompt(query: str) -> list:
    system_prompt = f"{prompt.SQL_REFORMAT_PROMPT}"
    q = f"""{query}"""
    user_prompt = f"""Good job, let's keep it going!\nRemember the pattern is <something>.\nHere is the next <question>\nPlease make sure you MUST answer in <output-format>'"""

    return [
        {"role": "system", "content": system_prompt},
        {"role": "user", "content": prompt.USER_Q1_PROMPT},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": prompt.ASSIST_ANS1_PROMPT},
        {"role": "user", "content": prompt.USER_Q2_PROMPT},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": prompt.ASSIST_ANS2_PROMPT},
        {"role": "user", "content": prompt.USER_Q3_PROMPT},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": prompt.ASSIST_ANS3_PROMPT},
        {"role": "user", "content": prompt.USER_Q4_PROMPT},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": prompt.ASSIST_ANS4_PROMPT},
        {"role": "user", "content": prompt.USER_Q5_PROMPT},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": prompt.ASSIST_ANS5_PROMPT},
        {"role": "user", "content": user_prompt},
    ]
```

And that's it, here is the final working BOT example.
