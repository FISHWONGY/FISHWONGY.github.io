</p>

And here is the comparison of deaths count in selected countries.

Then I want to explore the unemployment rate from the US. [CNBC recently posted a graph](https://twitter.com/CNBC/status/1269560572879802370) that attracts a tremendous amount of criticism.

And here are the accumulated graphs

Lastly, here is the US version of the graphs above.

For fun, I produced a hexagon map regarding the number of covid-19 cases and deaths
