>Since early May, many countries around the world have loosened their lockdown restrictions. Is the "peak" already passed?

The graph below shows the number of daily covid-19 cases recorded in different countries.
<p align="center">

</p>

Although it seems most of the chosen countries have passed the highest recorded cases day, looking at the active cases might tell another side of the story.

</p>

Furthermore, I produced a version that focuses on different states in the US, that might partly show why the USA curve as it is from the graph above.

So a while ago, I saw someone said, "people seem to die less during the weekend". Of course, we know it's just because people work more on weekdays instead of weekends, nevertheless, I still think it is an interesting pattern to visualise.

</p>

Although it looks like patients lose their lives less during the weekend, it is indeed Monday and Tuesday recorded the least covid-19 cases and deaths.

> So which countries have more daily recorded cases and what countries have less?

<img alt = 'png' width='800' src='/images/covid_13may20/ww_case.png'/>
</p>

Does a similar pattern apply to daily deaths as well?
<p align="center">
<img alt = 'png' width='800' src='/images/covid_13may20/ww_death.png'/>
</p>

And again, a US version of the graphs above.
<p align="center">

And a Europe version
<p align="center">
<img alt = 'png' width='800' src='/images/covid_13may20/eu_case.png'/>
</p>

<p align="center">
<img alt = 'png' width='800' src='/images/covid_13may20/eu_death.png'/>
</p>

Lastly, a Europe map showing active cases and daily cases increase in different EU countries.

Thanks for reading. Stay safe!
