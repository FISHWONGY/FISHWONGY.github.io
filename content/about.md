Data Engineering Lead in Cisco currently based in Toronto, Canada. I have lived in Hong Kong, Australia and UK before coming to Canada.

I enjoy working with data, talking about data architecture and telling story through data.

Also love photography, read and sleep.

I like books, and I do my best to read one book per week. I've been doing this for just over 2 years now.
